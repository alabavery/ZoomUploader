# ZoomUploader
**Automatically upload Zoom recordings to Google Drive**
## SetUp
- `> mkdir $HOME/.zoom-uploader`
- Get Google API token and paste into `$HOME/.zoom-uploader/credentials.json`
- Find directory path into which Zoom downloads recordings; paste into `$HOME/.zoom-uploader/zoom_directory.txt`
- download the `cmd` directory of this repo and place it into `$HOME/.zoom-uploader`
- download Docker if you don't have it
- create DockerHub account if you don't have one
- `> docker login --username=yourhubusername --email=youremail@company.com`
- You should now be able to start the script through `~/.zoom-uploader/cmd/start.sh` (subsequent starts will be much faster)
- Note that, if you have Docker set up to start on boot, this script will also start on boot (Docker automatically starts the script when Docker starts)
- You can then stop it through `~/.zoom-uploader/cmd/stop.sh`
